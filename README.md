# Hi, I'm Arslan 👋

I'm a Computer Vision Engineer with a strong interest in 3D vision, neural rendering, and event-based perception.
I hold an M.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from Politecnico di Milano 🇮🇹 and enjoy building intelligent visual systems that bridge the gap between research and real-world applications.

## 🔍 Areas of Interest

- 👁️ Computer Vision (2D, 3D, event-based)
- 🧠 Deep Learning for Visual Perception
- 📷 Neural Rendering (NeRF, Gaussian Splatting)
- ⚡ Neuromorphic Computing & Event Cameras
- 🚗 Vision for Autonomous Systems

## 🔧 Main Projects
